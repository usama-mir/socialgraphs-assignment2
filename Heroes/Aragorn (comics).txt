Aragorn has served as a mount for various characters.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===First Aragorn===\nProfessor Nathan Garrett, the criminal [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight]], developed genetic engineering techniques capable of granting a horse the wings of a bird. He used it to create a mount to ride during his criminal adventures.<ref>''The Avengers'' #48</ref> After Garrett's final defeat by [[Iron Man]],<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #73</ref> this horse escaped, was found and further mutated by Victor Frankenstein's great-granddaughter Victoria (who had originally tried to restore it to normal), and fell into the possession of the [[Dreadknight]], who named it the '''Hellhorse'''.<ref>''Iron Man'' #101-102</ref>\n\n===Second Aragorn===\nAs Garrett was dying, he persuades his nephew Dane Whitman to take his scientific discoveries and use them for good. Whitman thus became a new, heroic [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], and used his uncle's techniques to create another winged horse.

He rode Aragorn at the time when he accompanied [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] in his invasion of [[Wakanda]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #3</ref>\n\nWhen [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s son [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superbeings, Aragorn is clearly seen in one of the cages. However, after disobeying Kraven, Aragorn was killed to set an example to his other captives and then served up as food.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #13-14</ref> The ''Marvel Pets Handbook'' confirmed that the Aragorn that was killed by Alyosha Kravinoff was the Vatican Black Knight's Aragorn.<ref>''Marvel Pets Handbook''</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAragorn was a normal horse until [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]] used [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]'s techniques to give him large, fully feathered wings that allow him to fly. He is an experienced battle steed on land and aloft. Aragorn's enhanced intelligence gives him an excellent rapport with both the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and Dane Whitman, enabling him to understand and obey complex commands.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Aragorn_%28Earth-616%29 Aragorn] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Aragorn_%28Vatican%27s_Black_Knight%29_%28Earth-616%29 Vatican Black Knight's Aragorn] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/aragorn/4005-6810/ Aragorn] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Defenders}}\n{{Thor}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1968]]\n[[Category:Fictional horses]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}}}]}}}}
